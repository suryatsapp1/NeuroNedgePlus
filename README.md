NeuroNudge+ â€” full-stack Electron-ready productivity + mental-health AI coach.

Folders:
- frontend/  (React + Vite + Tailwind)
- backend/   (Node.js + Express + local LLM wrapper)
- electron/  (Electron packaging and shell)

This repo uses a JS-based LLM wrapper (e.g. `@xenova/transformers`). You must download model weights separately if you want a powerful local model.

See INSTALL & RUN section at the bottom of this file for step-by-step instructions.
